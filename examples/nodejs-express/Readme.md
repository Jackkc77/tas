## About these examples

These examples are based on Express official examples:
https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/examples/

These examples rewritten with Tas.
You do not need to run these examples.

Just compare the original code and the code rewritten with Tas,
you can see the logic and structure of the latter code is clearer.



## What's Tas

Tas simplifies code logic, making code easy to maintain.
Tas turns async code into sync code, avoiding callback hell,
and is faster and easier to use than Promise.

Tas can be used in Node.js and in browsers.
Tas is a lightweight JavaScript logic framework
(only 3KB gzipped), with no dependency.

Tas is the abbreviation of "tasks".
